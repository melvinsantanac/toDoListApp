# TO DO LIST APP

## Important information
* This is a practicing project to reenforce my knowledge about html, css and javascript and how to set and get data in the local storage.

* This project is using the local storage to save the data, therefore, it is highly recommended **NOT** to use this app to list any sensitive information, such as: ***credit card information, passwords, personal documentation***, etc.

* As the app is not connected to a backend, the date you save it is only available in the device you used to save it and are not accessible from any other device.

* HTML
